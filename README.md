# Deploy deploy!

WIP: currently in early development

**Deploy deploy!** deploys all the deployment things required to deploy *ALL THE THINGS*!

This repo is supposed to contain an opinionated **Ansible Collection** that provides the deployment of a **GitOps deployment workflow**  based on **ansible-pull** or **shell scripts** and **systemd**.

It deploys systemd units with Ansible that run the actual deployment routines. 


## Getting started
*Deploy deploy!* has two modes of operation:

- User mode: deployment runs in the scope of a systemd user session. It can be used for local development and deployment workflows for a singe user.
- System mode: deployment runs in the scope of the system. It can be used for deployment workflows for a whole system.
