# Coding instructions

## Specific deployment units.

The structure of the collection is centered around the deploy_instance role. This role creates an instance of the deploy@.service systemd units. 

This puts a ./deploy program into the deployment directory. It also creates an environment file at deploy.env and there is an deploy.init script to setup the environment for the deployment unit.

So for a specific role you just put the templates ./roles/{{role_name}}/templates/deploy.j2, ./roles/{{role_name}}/templates/deploy.env.j2 and ./roles/{{role_name}}/templates/deploy.init.j2 at deploy need to import the deploy_instance role like this in the tasks file at ././roles/{{role_name}}/tasks/main.yaml:
```ansible
- name: Import deploy instance role
  import_role:
    role: deploy_instance
```
